A tiny program that allows you to view an osu map's SV as a graph

You can check out other mode's maps. I haven't really tested those but it should work



### TODOS
- Settings
    - Change graph colors
    - Change marker style (color, size, show/hide)
- Open multiple diffs
- Make barline gimmicks not show (unless they're affecting a hitobject)
- ~Change marker size depending on zoom level~
- ~Add drag-and-drop to open diffs~
- ~Add auto-update thing~
